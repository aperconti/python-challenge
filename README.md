## PyBank 

In this challenge I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. I used a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.


I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset


The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
